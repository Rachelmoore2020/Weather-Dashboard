**Weather-Dashboard**<br>


As a person who needs to find weather information for any city, I want to be able to search by city and find not only today's weather, but the weather forecast for the next five days.

The weather dashboard allows a user to search any city and obtain up to date weather information including the next five days forecast. The weather information includes wind speed, humidity, temperature and ultra violet index. The background color of the uv index serves as a visual alert as to the risk level of exposure to uv rays.

the website includes other visual references in terms of weather icons that add to the aesthetics of the page and help the user gather weather information quickly.

The Weather Dashboard can be tried here:<br>
